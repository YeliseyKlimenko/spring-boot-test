# spring-boot-test

This is a simple web application that I made when learning Spring Boot. The web app interacts with a database that contains songs in order to save, delete and change their data. In order to run the app you need to create a database and a user that are mentioned in the src/main/resources/application.properties file, or just change them to whatever user or database you would like to use.
